# Google Books Search

### Overview

Create a new React-based Google Books Search app that work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to 
query and display books based on user searches. You'll also use Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or 
purchase later.


### Instructions

1.Add code to connect to a MongoDB database named `googlebooks` using the mongoose npm package.

2. Using mongoose, then create a Book schema.

3. At a minimum, books should have each of the following fields:

* `title` - Title of the book from the Google Books API

* `authors` - The books's author(s) as returned from the Google Books API

* `description` - The book's description as returned from the Google Books API

* `image` - The Book's thumbnail image as returned from the Google Books API

* `link` - The Book's information link as returned from the Google Books API

* Creating `documents` in your `books` collection similar to the following:

    ```js
    {
      authors: ["Suzanne Collins"]
      description: "Set in a dark vision of the near future, a terrifying reality TV show is taking place. Twelve boys and twelve girls are forced to appear in a live event called The Hunger Games. There is only one rule: kill or be killed. When sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen steps forward to take her younger sister's place in the games, she sees it as a death sentence. But Katniss has been close to death before. For her, survival is second nature."

      link: "http://books.google.com/books?id=sazytgAACAAJ&dq=title:The+Hunger+Games&hl=&source=gbs_api"
      title: "The Hunger Games"
    }
    ```
    
    ### Layout of page
    
    The layout should include at least two React Components for each page `Search` and `Saved`.

* Feel free to try out alternative CSS framework to Bootstrap.

6. Add the following Express routes for your app:

* `/api/books` (get) - Should return all saved books as JSON.

* `/api/books` (post) - Will be used to save a new book to the database.

* `/api/books/:id` (delete) - Will be used to delete a book from the database by Mongo `_id`.

* `*` (get) - Will load your single HTML page in `client/build/index.html`. Make sure you have this _after_ all other routes are defined.

* Deploy your application to Heroku once complete. **You must use Create React App** and current versions of React and React-Router-Dom for this assignment.
